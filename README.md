ShowdownShogun is a fully autonomous Pokémon Showdown bot designed to compete and win battles with advanced AI-driven strategies. Built with Python and powered by Keras, this bot demonstrates sophisticated reinforcement learning and environment interaction to battle opponents on the popular Pokémon Showdown platform.

## Features

- **Autonomous Battle Management**: Automatically handles all aspects of a Pokémon battle, from move selection to team switching.
- **Machine driven Strategies**: Utilizes basic machine learning algorithms to make  decisions during battle.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend or modify with new strategies or improvements.
- **Based on Poke-env**: Uses Poke-env as a framework for reinforcement learning

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ellaermeg/-ShowdownShogun.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd ShowdownShogun
  ```
3. Install the requiered dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the bot with the following command:
   ```bash
   python Bot.py
3. The bot will automatically connect to Pokémon Showdown and start participating in battles.


## Code Overview

### `Pokeenv.py`

This is the main environment file where the bot interacts with the Pokémon Showdown API. It sets up the battle environment, handles state transitions, and interfaces with the reinforcement learning model.
